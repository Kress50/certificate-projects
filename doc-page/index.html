						When, why, and how to properly use technical documentation
					</header>
					<p>
						Technical documentation helps an intended audience use your product,
						understand your processes, and get unstuck. Whether that audience is
						end-users, administrators, colleagues, or technicians doesn’t really
						matter. What does matter is that it’s clear, searchable, and helpful
						<span class="bold">for them</span>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Great technical documentation empowers your users, not frustrates
						them. It’s an integral part of not just customer support, but brand
						building and trust. Users seek it out when they’re most in need. And
						if it’s not there for them, they’ll start looking for alternatives.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here are a few examples of where and how you can use technical
						documentation:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">End-user support:</span>
							This means things like user guides, release notes, online help
							systems, training programs, or operating procedures—anything that
							helps users use your product.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Marketing support:</span>
							This could be functional and technical specifications, software
							development guides, or simply procedures and tools to help your
							developers do their jobs.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Development support:</span>
							This means things like user guides, release notes, online help
							systems, training programs, or operating procedures—anything that
							helps users use your product.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Organization support:</span>
							Information about your company, structure, procedures, workflows,
							policies, and anything else teammates need to know to do their
							jobs.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						While back in the day most of these documents would come as physical
						guides for users, today, most technical documentation should be
						available on your website or help pages (which is also great for
						SEO).

						How to plan, write, and deliver technical documentation that works
					</header>
					<p>
						So how do you create these clear, concise, wonderfully useful
						documents?
					</p>
					<p>
						First, you need to decide who is going to be responsible for them.
						Technical documentation is usually either written by a subject
						matter expert (i.e. someone who knows what they’re talking about),
						or a technical writer who’s been trained to translate complicated
						product knowledge into content that’s more easily understood by the
						end users.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once you’ve put your team together, writing technical documents
						comes down to a few simple steps.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section

					<header class="description">
						Step 1: Do research and create a 'Documentation Plan'
					</header>
					<p>As the old saying goes: “Write what you know.”</p>
					<img
						src="https://plan.io/images/blog/technical-documentation-write-what-you-know.png"
						alt="Brain holding note saying 'Write what you know'"
					/>
					<p>
						Every technical writing project starts with research. It might sound
						obvious, but knowing the purpose and scope of your technical
						documentation beforehand will save you a ton of time and energy (and
						headaches).
					</p>
					<p>
						If you’re not the subject matter expert, this might mean doing some
						internal interviews and building relationships with the technical
						team to get a stronger grasp on the material (and to avoid what
						senior technical writer
						<a
							href="https://medium.com/@willkelly/avoiding-mission-impossible-technical-writing-projects-cd4f64e15bad"
							>Will Kelly calls “Mission Impossible” technical writing
							projects)</a
						>. Or, it might be as simple as going through existing resources and
						guides and doing a short audit of what you have and what’s missing.
					</p>
					<p>
						All of this information goes in what’s called a
						<span class="bold">documentation plan</span>—a short outline to help
						guide you through the project. Here’s what you should include:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Goals:</span>
							Simply put, what do you want people to be able to do? Is it to use
							your product? Find help documents quickly and easily? Learn how to
							use certain aspects of your tool? Let teammates request resources
							or
							<a href="https://optimoroute.com/order-fulfillment/"
								>order fulfillment</a
							>?
							<a href="https://plan.io/blog/goal-setting-exercises/"
								>Having and knowing a clear goal</a
							>
							is essential to writing good technical documentation and will help
							inform everything you do.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Existing resources:</span>
							What’s currently out there? Are you updating or merging current
							resources or starting from scratch? Are there old, outdated
							versions that need to be killed? Do a quick audit and find
							anything and everything that will help you write or confuse your
							audience if they find it.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Style guides:</span>
							Some industries require you to write technical documentation in a
							specific way (like the
							<a href="https://plainlanguage.gov/">Plain Language</a>
							guidelines for government sites or Simplified Technical English
							for aerospace, aviation, or defense companies). In other cases,
							your company might have a style guide that explains what language
							to use, how to talk to users, and even grammatical styles.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Outline of topics:</span>
							What topics and subtopics will you be covering in your technical
							documentation? Think of this as a table of contents and try to
							list out every major section and subsection you think you’ll need.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Tools and management:</span>
							What software, tools, or websites will be used to create and
							manage the documentation? Link to relevant style guides.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Deadline and final deliverables:</span>
							When is it due and what format will it be in? Technical
							documentation is as much about structure and delivery as it is
							content. And knowing how the content will be presented before you
							start will tell you what you need and where to put your efforts.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section class="main-section" id="step_2:_structure_and_design">
					<header class="description">Step 2: Structure and design</header>
					<p>
						The goal of any technical documentation is to be usable. And a huge
						part of that is making it structurally logical and easy to navigate.
						Before you even get into creating content, you need to think about
						how that content is going to be presented.
					</p>
					<p>
						This means thinking about both
						<span class="bold">on page design</span> (how the individual
						technical documents look, what’s included in them, and the hierarchy
						of information) as well as the
						<span class="bold">navigational structure of your document</span>
						(what order is information presented in, how do users move around
						and navigate, what documents are linked or connected, etc...)
					</p>
					<p>Here are a few quick tips for each:</p>
					<header class="description" id="schemas">
						Use templates or “schemas” for consistent on-page design
					</header>
					<p>
						Have you ever flipped through a user manual or opened a help
						document and instantly knew it was bad?
					</p>
					<p>
						Most likely this wasn’t due to lack of information, but poor
						structure. The human brain has a thing called
						<span class="bold">cognitive fluency</span>, which refers to how
						easily we’re able to understand the information placed in front of
						us. If it’s hard to read (through poor design and layout) we
						experience the content as difficult or less useful.
					</p>
					<p>
						That’s why technical documentation is structured content. In order
						to be useful, it needs to be presented in a way that’s easy to parse
						quickly and find what you need.
					</p>
					<p>
						In most cases, this means using some sort of template or schema (a
						blueprint of how your data will be constructed). For example, your
						technical documentation template might look something like this:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Title:</span>
							What is it?
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Subtitle:</span>
							Additional information
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Overview:</span>
							What will you learn
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Table of contents:</span>
							Internal navigation
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Features:</span>
							Each section of the document
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Read next:</span>
							Related documents that might help the user
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Here’s an example using Planio wikis:</p>
					<img
						scr="https://plan.io/images/blog/planio-wiki-structure.png"
						alt="Planio support web page"
					/>
					<p>
						In this template, the user knows exactly what they’re reading, gets
						a short overview of what the document covers, and then has a table
						of contents outlining each step so they can jump to the most
						relevant one right away.
					</p>
					<p>
						Not only will keeping things organized like this help your users
						find information more quickly, but it will let you know if you have
						all the information you need to keep your content consistent.
					</p>
					<header class="description" id="simple_logical_navigation_structure">
						Create a simple, logical navigation structure
					</header>
					<p>
						Your project as a whole also needs to be organized in a way that
						makes sense and can be quickly parsed. What are the main topics that
						people will be searching for? Under each of those, what specific
						questions or documents will they be looking for?
					</p>
					<p>
						Hierarchy is incredibly important here, which is why Planio’s wiki
						lets you define your own structure and create parent-child
						relationships. Here’s what that might look like:
					</p>
					<img
						src="https://plan.io/images/blog/planio-wiki-table-of-contents.png?1657104146"
						alt="Table of contents for Planio wiki page"
					/>
					<p>
						Notice how each main category has relevant subcategories and then
						specific questions? This way, finding the information you need is
						quick and easy. No more aimless clicking and searching.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section class="main-section" id="step_3:_create_the_content">
					<header class="description">Step 3: Create the content</header>
					<p>
						Alright! With your <span class="bold">documentation plan</span> and
						<span class="bold">structure</span> in place, it’s time to get
						serious about creating your technical documents.
					</p>
					<img
						src="https://plan.io/images/blog/create-content-90-30-feedback-rule.png?1657104146"
						alt="Picture demonstrating the draft creation principles"
					/>
					<p>
						Like any writing project, the easiest way to create technical
						documentation is to follow a few steps rather than try to dive right
						in and start writing. Here’s the easiest way to make sure what
						you’re creating is useful, valuable, and clear:
					</p>
					<header class="description" id="start_with_the_draft">
						Start with a draft
					</header>
					<p>
						Using the information in your documentation plan, you can start to
						sketch out a high-level outline for each of the topics you’ll be
						covering. This is a great place to find holes in your planning and
						research as they’ll become painfully obvious as you start to create
						an outline.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once you’ve finished the outline, gather the rest of the specific
						content you’ll need for each topic and any
						<a href="https://visme.co/blog/blog-graphics/"
							>supporting graphics</a
						>. If you get stuck along the way, leave a placeholder or internal
						note to come back and fill it out.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, if you’re writing a “how to” or help guide, you should follow
						along and do a self-review to make sure everything you’re writing
						can be done. Always remember that your technical documentation is
						<span class="bold">for the user</span>. If they can’t easily
						navigate, read, and use what you’re creating, it’s useless.
					</p>
					<p><span class="bold">A few quick tips on writing well:</span></p>
					<p>
						Writing doesn’t come naturally to everyone. Especially when the
						subject matter is dense, technical, or complicated. But because your
						ultimate goal is clarity, you’ll want to follow a few simple rules:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Write like a human:</span>
							Use simple, clear language whenever possible. We’ve all read those
							documents that sound like Google Translate gone wrong. If you find
							yourself slipping into awkward sentences or complicated language,
							step away for a few minutes. Sometimes coming back to a piece of
							writing after a short break is all it takes to refresh your mind.
						</li>
						<li>
							R<span class="bold">emember, your readers aren’t you:</span>
							The golden commandment of technical writing is thou shalt not
							assume. You might think you’re being obvious, but you have to be
							keenly aware of the knowledge level your audience is at. Don’t
							assume they know even half as much as you.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold"
								>Write as much as needed to be helpful and not a word
								more:</span
							>
							Short writing is good writing. Use formatting to break up large
							chunks of text and keep clarity front and center. As Amazon
							technical writer Tom Johnson
							<a
								href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2015/11/04/questions-about-technical-writing-careers/"
								>writes</a
							>:
							<span class="bold">
								“A good technical writer reduces the word count to just the
								right brevity without being obscure.”
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Remember the power of visuals:</span>
							It’s another cliche, but pictures really do say a thousand words.
							Whenever possible, visualize what you’re saying rather than try to
							explain it.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<header class="description" id="thirty_ninety_rule">
						Use the 30/90 rule to get feedback
					</header>
					<p>
						Along the way, you’ll want to get feedback on your technical
						documents, both as a gut check to make sure you’re not getting
						overly complicated as well as to ensure you’re explaining things
						properly.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unless you’re an expert in the topic you’re writing about, it’s a
						good idea to have a subject matter expert (SME) come in after the
						first draft and final draft to review. Giving feedback is a skill in
						itself. And when it comes to technical documentation, one of the
						best ways to frame it is as what Jason Freedman calls “<a
							href="https://42floors.com/blog/startups/thirty-percent-feedback"
							>30/90 feedback</a
						>”.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">At 30% done</span> (your first draft or outline),
						you’re not asking for in-depth feedback or
						<a href="https://firstsiteguide.com/grammar-checker-tools/">
							reviewing or typos and grammar </a
						>, but rather for the reviewer to engage in the broader outline,
						flow, and structure of the document. While
						<span class="bold">at 90% done</span> (your final draft), you’re
						asking them to go over the documentation with a fine-tooth comb and
						nit-pick any issues.
					</p>
					<p>
						Building in a steady schedule of reviews will make sure you don’t
						have any nasty surprises when you go to submit your final
						documentation.
					</p>
					<header class="description" id="peer_reviews_revisions">
						Get peer reviews and make revisions
					</header>
					<p>
						In between reviews from the SME you’ll also want to set up
						peer-review sessions to make sure the content is accessible and
						usable to your intended audience. Ask
						<a href="https://plan.io/blog/project-stakeholder/"
							>a project stakeholder</a
						>
						or someone outside the project to go over your documents and pick
						out anywhere they get lost or confused.
					</p>
					<p>
						It can be disheartening to hear that someone doesn’t understand what
						you wrote. But always remember to
						<span class="bold">keep the user front of mind</span>. If someone
						within your company got lost following your directions, a total
						outsider doesn’t have a chance.
					</p>
					<header class="description" id="edit_more_edit">
						Edit, edit, and edit some more
					</header>
					<p>
						Good writing comes down to editing. With your feedback and revisions
						in place, break out your style guides and either edit the
						documentation yourself or take it to a technical editor who can make
						sure the language has a logical flow and is consistent throughout.
						Whenever possible, you should try to get a second set of eyes on
						your content.
					</p>
					<p>
						Planio wikis are especially powerful for editing with version
						control, history, and roles and permissions to make sure you and
						your team stay on top of who's written and edited what.

				<section class="main-section" id="step_4:_deliver_and_test">
					<header class="description">Step 4: Deliver and test</header>
					<p>
						Once your documentation is put together and live, it’s time to get
						some real-world feedback on it. Unfortunately, this step often gets
						skipped during the development of technical documents (as most
						companies don’t have the time and resources or think it’s not worth
						it). But, as we’ve said multiple times in this guide already,
						technical documentation is all about the user. If it doesn’t work
						for them, it’s a failure.
					</p>
					<p>
						Start with a simple <span class="bold">safety check</span>. This
						means going through any documents, directions, or use cases that
						could potentially cause someone’s computer harm if done improperly.
						This could mean exposure of personal data, deleting of important
						information, etc… You’ll know best based on your product.
					</p>
					<p>
						As part of the safety check, you should make sure to revisit the
						topics on basic functionality and terms explained as these are the
						core of your documents and should be precise.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, do a <span class="bold">navigation audit</span>. Remember that
						your document structure is key. If users can’t get around them
						easily they’re just as useless. Check for broken links and make sure
						navigational elements are working and obvious (if you don’t have
						any, you’ll probably want to add some).
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, <span class="bold">check for usability/UX issues</span>. Are
						users getting lost or confused? Are they not getting the answers
						they were looking for (or thought they were getting based on
						headlines or navigation?) The experience for the user comes down to
						more than just what you’ve written. Take the time to work with
						outside testers to make sure that when real users come to your
						documents, they leave happy.

						The 4 additional qualities of great technical documentation
					</header>
					<p>
						If it’s not clear by now, the one thing your technical documentation
						has to have is clarity. Ease-of-use is your top priority. But it
						isn’t your only one. As you put together your technical
						documentation, aim for these 4 other qualities:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Efficiency in development and use:</span>
							Duplicated content, unorganized structures, and unclear processes
							can kill technical documentation. Use a tool like Planio’s wikis
							to keep content organized and efficient.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Up-to-date information:</span>
							There’s no point in giving your users inaccurate information or
							showing them dated screenshots that don’t look like what they’re
							dealing with. Keep your technical documentation up-to-date and
							current.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Consistent design and structure:</span>
							Every time you get in contact with your users is a time to build
							your brand. Keep consistent with your design, style, and tone
							across all online documentation.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Accessible anywhere:</span>
							Mobile is taking over the world. Your technical documentation,
							just like the rest of your website or app, needs to be responsive
							and provide a great experience for users on all devices.

					<p>
						It’s easy to downplay the role technical documentation plays in your
						company’s success. But the truth is that the easier it is for a user
						to find the information they need to use your product, the more
						they’re going to enjoy it, stay loyal to your brand, and recommend
						you to other people.
					</p>
					<p>
						Technical documentation is more than just another task to be checked
						off your list. It’s an essential part of supporting the people that
						support you. So take the time to follow this guide, create a clear,
						accurate structure, and write content that turns your users into
						product superheroes.
